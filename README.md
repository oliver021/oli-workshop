# oli-workshop - Workshop helpers 
A very helpful collection of tools and code libraries for dotnet core.

## Introduction 🚀

Set of bookstores and libraries of great help that I have used personally and mainly to develop problems that require robust solutions.

### Threading Helpers.

This set of libraries helps with tasks, asynchronous processes and high complexity of parallelism, allowing you flexibility and robustness of process in few instructions.

By means of the API available in these helpers, an architecture that supports concurrency of multiple actions, events and tasks can be consolidated for parallel  execution and without deadlock or excessive blocks.
